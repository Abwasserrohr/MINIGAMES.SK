Each game should contain all scripts that it needs within a folder that is named exactly like the game.
Do not put other folders into this games folder.

The core script will initialize your game by enabling a init.sk file in your game folder.
Example: MINIGAMES.SK/games/mygame/init.sk

The init.sk file should contain a initialization process which starts your game, and all events that can
trigger something in your game. Be sure to leave the init.sk file as small as possible and use functions
to make init.sk loading fast. It will be disabled once the game ends to ensure as few as possible triggers
being available.

Adding any events outside of your init.sk file can cause lags and interrupt other games.

Make sure that all while loops and other processes are stopped as fast as possible once the game changes
or the game status is set to "".
