# MINIGAMES.SK
A minigames library for servers using [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) with high customizability and an easy API to add new minigames on your own. Created for small server networks that don't need an entire network out of minigame servers.

**MINIGAMES.SK is still work in progress. It might work, but issues can occcur.**

### Dependencies
- [Spigot](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT) Minecraft Java version 1.14.4

### [Documentation](https://github.com/Abwasserrohr/MINIGAMES.SK/blob/master/MINIGAMES.SK/docs/index.md)

### Why MINIGAMES.SK
MINIGAMES.SK has a unique vote & play system which allows even small servers to offer minigames, since it only needs one server on which all minigames are being voted and played. Thanks to a changeable minimum amount of players for specific minigames, only fitting minigames for the amount of players are available.
MINIGAMES.SK aims to give a great experience for players and server operators from just one player to up to 60 players. Skript is [well documented](http://skriptlang.github.io/Skript/), free and accessible to everyone who can read and write.
